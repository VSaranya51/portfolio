                <p>
                  I’m a Product Owner evolving into a Product Manager, with a strong technical foundation in backend development and IT project delivery. I specialize in turning business needs into structured product solutions — from discovery and requirement definition to backlog ownership and sprint delivery.
    
    I currently work on digital booking and sales platforms in the golf travel industry, where I collaborate closely with stakeholders and engineering teams to improve workflows, partner visibility, and operational efficiency. </br> My focus is not just shipping features, but ensuring every release delivers measurable value.
    
    I enjoy bridging the gap between business and technology, simplifying complex processes, and building products that scale. My goal is to grow into a product leadership role where I can combine strategy, delivery, and user impact.
